# Instructions  

  You are given a file *main.c* with some initial code.
  ## Example Runs

  The run examples may be entered in a *shell* window or a *console* window. The outputs are the required and expected results.

  - ./main
    
    usage: main name
  - ./main Irving
    
    hello, Irving. Happy New Year!
    
  - ./main Irving Berlin

    hello, Irving. hello Berlin. Happy New Year!

  - ./main "Jean Paul Sartre"
  
    hello, Jean Paul Sartre. Happy New Year!

  ## Steps
  1. Write single module C program that uses scalar values.
  2. Add command line argument input processing.
  3. Document the C program.
  4. Add the header for using EXIT_SUCCESS definition.
  5. Research using [https://en.cppreference.com/w/c].
  6. Also refer to content at [https://www.cs.rit.edu/~csci243/].
  7. Press the *Run* button whenever you are ready to test. This button will compile and link your program and then execute it with a single command line argument "whoRU?".
  8. Check the output in the *console* window.
  9. Study any errors produced by the compiler and the program.
  10. Add comments and questions to the file comment block at the top of the main.c file.
  11. Submit when ready.

  Here is example docstring content using 'triple-quote' format C comments. Note that function and variable docstrings must come *before the code component*. 
```
/// myvariable is a global public value (deprecated)
int myvariable;

```
