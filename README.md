# C4cs-e-c-1

Apparently, I can download TEAM content from a project lesson into
a local host folder and create a github repo for the content.

BUT, I cannot attach the repo to the TEAM lesson because I 
cannot connect the repl. I also cannot see it as a choice.

Attempts to connect the TEAM repl to the github repo failed.
